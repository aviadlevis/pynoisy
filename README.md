pynoisy
---
pynoisy is:
1. A python wrapper for a modified version of the `inoisy` code [1] that supports arbitrary xarray matrices as diffusion tensor fields. 
pynoisy can be used to generate 3D (spatio-temporal) Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation [2,3] (SPDE), which is solved using `HYPRE` computing library [4]. `Tutorial1` within the tutorials directory gives a notebook example on generation of GRFs.

2. A tool for inferring parameters of stochastic fluid dynamics of black-hole accretion from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements. 
EHT measurements are Very Large Baseline Intereferometric (VLBI) measurements which are synthesized using `eht-imaging` [5]. 


Installation
----
Installation using using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package management.  
The following installation steps assume that MPI (e.g. [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/), [mpich](https://www.mpich.org/)) is installed and was tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.5.
Alternatively, use [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) to generate a container with MPI and conda as explained below.

Clone pynoisy repository with the inoisy submodule
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aviadlevis/pynoisy.git
cd pynoisy
```
Clone and install [HYPRE](https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre) library. To install HYPRE, some version of MPI ([OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)/[MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/)) needs to be installed. If HYPRE was previously installed make sure to have `HYPRE_DIR` point to the right path.
```
git clone https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre.git
cd hypre/src
./configure
make install
cd ../../
``` 
Start a virtual environment with new environment variables
```
conda create -n pynoisy python=3.7.4
conda activate pynoisy
conda env config vars set INOISY_DIR=$(pwd)/inoisy HYPRE_DIR=$(pwd)/hypre/src/hypre 
conda env config vars set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$(pwd)/hypre/src/hypre/lib/
conda activate pynoisy
```
Install pynoisy 
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
pip install .
```
Install [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) and its dependencies
```
conda install -c conda-forge xarray dask netCDF4 bottleneck
```
Install [eht-imaging](https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging)
```
conda install -c conda-forge pynfft requests scikit-image
git clone https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging.git
cd eht-imaging
pip install .
cd ../
``` 

Getting Started
----
The easiest way to get started is through the jupyter notebooks in the `tutorials` directory.
These notebooks cover both the generation (forward) and estimation (inverse) methods and procedures. Furthermore, 
basic utility and visualization methods are introduced and used throughout.



Singularity Container
----
Login and enter API access token
```
singularity remote login
```
Build the image to a .sif file
```
singularity build --remote pynoisy_mpi.sif pynoisy_mpi.def
```
Run a singularity shell 
```
singularity shell pynoisy_mpi.sif
```
Proceed with the installation instruction (above) cloning and installing pynoisy and the required dependencies (HYPRE, xarray, eht-imaging etc).
