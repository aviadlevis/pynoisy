pynoisy
---
pynoisy is:
1. A python wrapper for a modified version of the `inoisy` code [1] that supports arbitrary xarray matrices as diffusion tensor fields. 
pynoisy can be used to generate 3D (spatio-temporal) Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation [2,3] (SPDE), which is solved using `HYPRE` computing library [4].   
`Tutorial1` within the tutorials directory gives a notebook example on generation of GRFs.

2. A tool for inferring parameters of stochastic fluid dynamics of black-hole accretion from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements. 
EHT measurements are Very Large Baseline Intereferometric (VLBI) measurements which are synthesized using `eht-imaging` [5]. 


Installation
----
Installation using using [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package management.  
The following installation steps assume that MPI (e.g. [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/), [mpich](https://www.mpich.org/)) is installed and has been tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.5.

Clone pynoisy repository with the inoisy submodule
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aviadlevis/pynoisy
cd pynoisy
```
Clone and install [HYPRE](https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre) library. If HYPRE was previously installed make sure to have `HYPRE_DIR` point to the right path.
```
git clone https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre.git
cd hypre/src
./configure
make install
cd ../../
``` 
Start a virtual environment and export ./inoisy directory environment variable (this path will be used to mpirun compiled executables)
```
conda create -n pynoisy python=3.7.4
conda activate pynoisy
conda env config vars set INOISY_DIR=$(pwd)/inoisy HYPRE_DIR=$(pwd)/hypre/src/hypre LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HYPRE_DIR/lib/
conda activate pynoisy
```
Install [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) and its dependencies and other required packages
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
conda install -c conda-forge xarray dask netCDF4 bottleneck
```
