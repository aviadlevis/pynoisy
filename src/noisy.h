noisy:

Generate a gaussian random field in 2D with 
locally anisotropic correlation function, 
locally varying correlation time.

Follows the technique of 
Lindgren, Rue, and Lindstr\:om 2011, J.R. Statist. Soc. B 73, pp 423-498.

in particular, implements eq. 17, which has power spectrum given by eq. 18.

Based on work by 
David Daeyoung Lee 
Charles Gammie
on applications in disk turbulence.
